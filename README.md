# 40kListApp

This project is mostly just a way for me to familiarize myself with C# programming. I've wanted to make this project in different languages over the life of Warhmamer 40k 9th edition, so I figured I should get it done before 10th comes out this year.

This app isn't incredibly feature heavy as it is simply a learning tool for me presently, though that may change in the future.
